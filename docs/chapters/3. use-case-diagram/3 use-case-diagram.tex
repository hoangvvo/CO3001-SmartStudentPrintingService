The whole system of SmartStudentPrintingService contains 5 modules:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Account Management Service:} This module is responsible for managing user accounts within the system, specifically catering to the administrative functions. It allows administrators to create, redefine, deactivate, or delete user accounts, including those of students and Student Printing Service Officers (SPSOs).

\item \textbf{User Authentication Service:} The User Authentication Service ensures secure access to the system by verifying the identity of users. It utilizes the HCMUT\_SSO authentication service to authenticate students and other users before granting access to the system's features.

\item \textbf{Payment Service:} This module facilitates online payments for students to purchase additional printing pages. It integrates with payment systems like BKPay, allowing students to extend their page balance for printing. The service ensures that purchased page balances are reflected immediately within the application.

\item \textbf{Printing Service:} The Printing Service is a core component that enables students to initiate and manage print jobs. It handles the upload and printing of documents, printer selection, specifying printing properties (e.g., paper size, page range), and maintaining a history of printing actions. It also enforces page balance checks and notifications when balance is depleted.

\item \textbf{File Service:} The File Service is responsible for securely handling and storing uploaded document files by students. It ensures that files are accessible only to the respective student who uploaded them and authorized personnel, such as SPSOs. This module plays a crucial role in maintaining data privacy and security.

\item \textbf{Reporting Service:} The Reporting Service automatically generates and stores reports summarizing system usage. It compiles statistics on page usage, the number of students using the service, and provides comparisons with previous time intervals (monthly and yearly). These reports are valuable for assessing resource utilization and making informed decisions about the printing service.
